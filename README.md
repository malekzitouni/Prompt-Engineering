## Introduction
Welcome to the Prompt-Engineering repository! This project aims to provide tools and techniques for effective prompt engineering, enhancing the interaction between users and AI models.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for prompt creation.
- **Customizable**: Tailor prompts to suit various use cases.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance and accuracy.
- **Work iteratively** to craft prompts that are **specific**, provide **cues** and give the model **"time to think"**.
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on unstructured text.
- Understand the LLaMA-2 **prompt template** and its role in **instruction fine-tuning**.
- Provide LLMs with instructive examples using **few-shot learning**.
- Use LLMs to generate structured data for potential use in downstream tasks.
- Assign a role to the model using **system context** in order to perform a variety of **text generation** tasks.
- Use **sampling** and **temperature** to control the randomness of a model's outputs.
- Enable **chatbot** functionality with a model, including the ability to retain conversation history.
- Create **AI assistants** capable of discussing task-specific details, provided as data.
- Generate **synthetic data**.
- Work within the constraints of a model's **token limit**.

## Additional Information
In this course, we came up against some boundaries of LLM capabilities based on the limitations of the amount of tokens it can process.

[Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) (or RAG) allows an LLM to fetch relevant information from a large corpus of data (like a vector database, such as [FAISS](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss)), and formulate coherent responses based on that retrieved information. This allows the model to "look up" vast amounts of information without needing to remember it all in the immediate context (such as its prompt).

RAG both largely eliminates the constraints placed on us in prompt engineering from token limits, and also provides a powerful mechanism to make the model aware of information that it may not have been initially trained on.

At the time of writing this, the DLI is developing a comprehensive course on building RAG systems. Keep an eye on the DLI catalog for the release of this course towards the beginning of 2024.

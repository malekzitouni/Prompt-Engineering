## Introduction
Welcome to the Prompt-Engineering repository! This project aims to provide tools and techniques for effective prompt engineering, enhancing the interaction between users and AI models.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for prompt creation.
- **Customizable**: Tailor prompts to suit various use cases.
- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance and accuracy.
- **Work iteratively** to craft prompts that are **specific**, provide **cues** and give the model **"time to think"**.
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on unstructured text.
- Understand the LLaMA-2 **prompt template** and its role in **instruction fine-tuning**.
- Provide LLMs with instructive examples using **few-shot learning**.
- Use LLMs to generate structured data for potential use in downstream tasks.
- Assign a role to the model using **system context** in order to perform a variety of **text generation** tasks.
- Use **sampling** and **temperature** to control the randomness of a model's outputs.
- Enable **chatbot** functionality with a model, including the ability to retain conversation history.
- Create **AI assistants** capable of discussing task-specific details, provided as data.
- Generate **synthetic data**.
- Work within the constraints of a model's **token limit**.
